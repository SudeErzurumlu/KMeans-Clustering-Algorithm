# KMeans-Clustering-Algorithm

This project implements the K-Means Clustering Algorithm in six different programming languages: Python, R, MATLAB, Julia, Ruby, and C. 
The K-Means algorithm is widely used in data science for clustering tasks, where data is grouped into a specified number of clusters 
based on their similarities. This algorithm is essential for applications such as image segmentation, customer segmentation, and data analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into separate folders for each language. Each folder contains a single file that independently performs K-Means clustering 
on a given dataset. Below is the directory structure:

```
KMeans-Clustering-Algorithm/
├── Python/
│   └── kmeans_clustering.py
├── R/
│   └── kmeans_clustering.R
├── MATLAB/
│   └── kmeans_clustering.m
├── Julia/
│   └── kmeans_clustering.jl
├── Ruby/
│   └── kmeans_clustering.rb
└── C/
    └── kmeans_clustering.c
```

## Languages & Files

- **Python** (`kmeans_clustering.py`): Implements the algorithm using NumPy for numerical operations.
- **R** (`kmeans_clustering.R`): Uses base R functions to perform matrix operations and clustering.
- **MATLAB** (`kmeans_clustering.m`): MATLAB script implementing the K-Means clustering on matrices.
- **Julia** (`kmeans_clustering.jl`): High-performance Julia implementation for matrix-based clustering.
- **Ruby** (`kmeans_clustering.rb`): Implements K-Means clustering with Ruby’s array and vector manipulation.
- **C** (`kmeans_clustering.c`): Implements K-Means clustering using arrays and pointers for memory efficiency.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure to have the necessary software installed for each language you intend to use:

- **Python**: Python 3.x, with `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries.
- **R**: R environment (latest version).
- **MATLAB**: MATLAB environment.
- **Julia**: Julia environment.
- **Ruby**: Ruby (latest version).
- **C**: C compiler (e.g., GCC).

### Running the Algorithm

Each language folder contains instructions on how to run the respective file. In general, for each file:

1. **Python**:
    ```bash
    cd Python
    python kmeans_clustering.py
    ```

2. **R**:
    ```bash
    cd R
    Rscript kmeans_clustering.R
    ```

3. **MATLAB**:
    Open `kmeans_clustering.m` in MATLAB and run it.

4. **Julia**:
    ```bash
    cd Julia
    julia kmeans_clustering.jl
    ```

5. **Ruby**:
    ```bash
    cd Ruby
    ruby kmeans_clustering.rb
    ```

6. **C**:
    ```bash
    cd C
    gcc kmeans_clustering.c -o kmeans_clustering
    ./kmeans_clustering
    ```

## Usage

Each implementation initializes a set of cluster centroids and assigns data points to the nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance. 
The centroids are updated iteratively until convergence or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

The provided implementations can be customized by modifying the number of clusters (`k`) or the maximum number of iterations.

## Example Output

The output of each file will generally consist of:
- The final positions of the centroids.
- The cluster assignment of each data point.
